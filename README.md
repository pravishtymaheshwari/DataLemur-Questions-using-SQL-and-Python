# DataLemur-Questions-using-SQL-and-Python
This repository showcases my solution to the problems on [DataLemur üêí (Ace the SQL & Data Interview)](https://datalemur.com/questions) by Nick Singh. Data Lemur is a platform which offers 100+ data science interview questions but it exclusively relies on SQL for solutions. Recognizing an opportunity to broaden my skillset, I've chosen to take these same questions using Python.
